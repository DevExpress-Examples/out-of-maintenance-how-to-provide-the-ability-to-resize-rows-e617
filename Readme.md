# How to provide the ability to resize rows


<p><strong>Description</strong>:<br />
Â I am trying to provide my end-users with the ability to change a specific row's height via the mouse. Is there a way to implement this feature? </p><p><strong>Solution</strong>:<br />
Â The XtraGrid doesnâ€™t provide such a feature automatically due to the fact that it doesn't cache any data internally. Thus it canâ€™t store different row sizes.  However, you can implement this task yourself.  To do this you should handle the GridView's <strong>MouseDown</strong>, <strong>MouseUp</strong> and <strong>CalcRowHeight</strong> events.  Within the <strong>MouseDown</strong> and  the <strong>MouseUp</strong> events you should handle row size changing.  Within the <strong>CalcRowHeight</strong> event handler you should pass the valid row height for a specific row.  In the attached project you will find a sample project which demonstrates this task</p>
